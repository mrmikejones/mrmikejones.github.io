  <h2>Recommended Resources</h2>
  <p>
	This is a collection of resources that I've found helpful over the years. My
	focus is game audio specific, so your mileage may vary.
  </p>
  <h3>A Tour of C++</h3>
  <p>
	Good reference for getting up to speed with modern C++. Requires background
	in programming.
  </p>
  <h3>The Computer Music Tutorial</h3>
  <p>
	Huge amount of helpful information packed into a single book. Might be a bit
	dated now, was a great buy whilst I was studying at university.
  </p>
  <h3>Room Acoustics Modeling, with Interactive Visualizations</h3>
  <p>
	Even in it's unfinished state this is a great resource about interactive
	acoustics. I'd love to see Lauri Savioja finish this.
  </p>
  <h3>The Sound Reinforcement Handbook</h3>
  <p>
	Targetted at live sound. Was another great buy when I was studying at university.
  </p>
  <h3>Music-DSP Mailing List</h3>
  <p>
	Lots of very knowledgeable members and discussion. The mailing list is
	pretty quiet now, but the archives are online and useful too.
  </p>
  <h3>VGM Mailing List</h3>
  <p>
	Mailing list for working professionals in game audio. The mailing list has a
	huge reach. A bit quieter than it used to be.
