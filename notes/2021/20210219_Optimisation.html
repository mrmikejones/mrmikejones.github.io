   Optimisation
  </h2>
  <p>
   I've been reading up a lot on optimisation lately. This page is to capture resources and things I learn before
        they are forgotton and lost to the ether.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Performance Analysis Tuning Modern CPUs
  </h3>
  <p>
   I bought the printed version of this off Amazon. There is a free pdf available too.
  </p>
  <p>
   Good introduction to optimisation. I don't use Linux or Intel VTune so some bits were a bit wasted on me.
  </p>
  <p>
   I need to go through the book again, and properly take in some of the sections.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dennis also has a website -
   <a href="easyperf.net">
    easyperf
   </a>
   . Lots of posts worth reading, a lot of this seems
        to be then incorportated into the book.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is also a
   <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2021/02/05/Performance-analysis-and-tuning-contest-4">
    performance analysis
            and tuning challenge
   </a>
   , looks interesting.
  </p>
  <h3>
   What every systems programmer should know about concurrency
  </h3>
  <p>
   Quite enjoying this. Nice short read, and I like the writing style. Will spend more time looking through the rest
        of
   <a href="bitbashing.io">
    Bit Bashing
   </a>
   website, althrough it does not look like the site has updated in a
        while.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?
  </h3>
  <p>
   I'm just getting started on this one. Bit more of a hefty read. Looks like this one has promise and will be a
        good read.
