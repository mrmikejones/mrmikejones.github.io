   This popped up on

   and got me thinking about my website. I was already quite interested in
   <a class="note_link" href="../2020/20201029_Zettelkasten.html">
    Zettelkasten
   </a>
   , and Digital Gardens are very similar.

    The Garden and the Stream: A
            Technopastoral

   was a good read, but I can't find Mike Caulfield's garden to have a look at, which is a
        shame.

   For this site, I'd like to get better at adding articles more often. I
        should make more regular smaller changes. I've also been working on a site generator which I'd like to add
        support for
        backlinks to.

   I'd previously thought of my notes as immutable, but it's an odd restriction and one that I won't be continuing.
        Knowledge changes, we grow, and my notes should reflect that. I don't want to stubbornly cling on to my first
        understanding of something, and my notes should reflect that. Just like a garden, sometimes you need to weed,
        replant and trim back so that things can flourish.
