  <h2>Zettelksaten</h2>
  <p>
	This seems to be something that pops up on Hacker News quite regularly. My
	note taking was already very similar, but without tags (which I've now added). 
  </p>
  <p>
	The most important thing is that the system does not get in the way. That's
	one of the reasons this website is completely written in html. I'd get too
	bogged down in frameworks, getting things running, etc. It would get in the
	way of actually having a website with content.
  </p>
  <p>
	It's a lesson that can be applied in many areas; don't get bogged down in
	details at the expense of actually achieving the end goal.
