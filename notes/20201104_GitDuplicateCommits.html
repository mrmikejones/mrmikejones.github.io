  <h2>Git : Duplicate commits</h2>
  <p>
	One situation that can cause duplication of commits is doing a rebase on a
	branch which changes commits that are already in trunk.
  </p>
  <p>
	The rebase doesn't change the existing commit, it actually copies the
	commit. This means there is a new hash, and an entirely new commit.
  </p>
  <p>
	Once there are duplicate commits in trunk, they are there to stay. Doing a
	rebase of trunk, and dropping the duplicate commits might work but it is
	risky. My preference would be to have a messy commit history over using rebase
	on trunk, re-writing history and the potential for creating a lot more
	problems.
  </p>
  <p>
	This is the reason that rebase comes with the warning to not rebase commits
	that someone else might have. In this case, someone else <i>did</i> have the
	commits - trunk. 
  </p>
