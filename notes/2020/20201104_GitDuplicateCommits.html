    <h2 class=note_title>Git : Duplicate commits</h2>
    <p>
        One situation that can cause duplication of commits is doing a rebase on a
        branch which changes commits that are already in trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rebase doesn't change the existing commit, it actually copies the
        commit. This means there is now an entirely new commit in the history when
        compared to trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
        When merging branch back to trunk, Git needs to resolve the difference in
        history between trunk and the branch. The resolution is to add all commits
        from the new commit onwards onto the end of trunk's commit history.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the duplicate commits are in trunk they are there to stay. Doing a
        rebase of trunk, and dropping the duplicate commits, might work but it is
        risky. My preference would be to have a messy commit history. Doing a rebase
        on trunk and re-writing history has the potential to create a lot more
        problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rebase comes with the warning to not rebase commits that someone else might
        have. In this case, someone else <i>did</i> have the commits - trunk.
    </p>
