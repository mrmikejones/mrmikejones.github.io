    <h2 class=note_title>Recommended Resources</h2>
    <p>
        This is a collection of resources that I've found helpful over the years. My
        focus is game audio specific, so your mileage may vary.
    </p>
    <h3>A Tour of C++</h3>
    <p>
        Good reference for getting up to speed with modern C++. Requires background
        in programming.
    </p>
    <h3>The Computer Music Tutorial</h3>
    <p>
        Huge amount of helpful information packed into a single book. Might be a bit
        dated now, was a great buy whilst I was studying at university.
    </p>
    <h3>Room Acoustics Modeling, with Interactive Visualizations</h3>
    <p>
        Even in it's unfinished state this is a great resource about interactive
        acoustics. I'd love to see Lauri Savioja finish this.
    </p>
    <h3>The Sound Reinforcement Handbook</h3>
    <p>
        Targetted at live sound. Was another great buy when I was studying at university.
    </p>
    <h3>Music-DSP Mailing List</h3>
    <p>
        Lots of very knowledgeable members and discussion. The mailing list is
        pretty quiet now, but the archives are online and useful too.
    </p>
    <h3>VGM Mailing List</h3>
    <p>
        Mailing list for working professionals in game audio. The mailing list has a
        huge reach. A bit quieter than it used to be.
