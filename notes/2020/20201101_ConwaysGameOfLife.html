  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules">
	  <ol>
	      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
		  <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
		  <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other
		  dead cells stay dead.</li>

  <h3>Undecideability</h3>
  <p>
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Undecidability">
	  The Game of Life is undecidable, which means that given an initial pattern
	  and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later
	  pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the halting
	  problem: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish
	  running or continue to run forever from an initial input.
	</blockquote>
  </p>
  <h3>Algorithm</h3>
  <p>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Algorithms">Algorithms</a>
	section on the Wikipedia has some interesting snippets of
	information about the implementation. This is a neat way of calculating the
	next state of a cell; <blockquote>if the sum of all nine fields in a given
	neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will
	be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current
	  state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.</blockquote>
